One of foundation to SOLID is Single Responsibility. Letâ€™s talk directly by an Example how we can implement Single responsibility inside our code below. Within sample program there are two solutions to find Volume of rectangular prism.

### First solution within RectangularPrismOne class
- We embedding Rectangle inside RectangularPrism class.
- We count total area of rectangle and count volume for rectangular prism (two things).
### Second solution within RectangularPrismTwo class
- Using two classes to get the result.
- Class Rectangle responsible to count total area
- Class RectangularPrismTwo responsible only count volume
- RectangularPrismTwo receive an rectangle object as params
- Let rectangle object to count total area (responsible is within Rectangle class) and get the result to get volume (responsible is within RectangularPrism)
